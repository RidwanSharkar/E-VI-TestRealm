# Eidolon IV

> Death offers an alluring covenant laced with grotesque mockery...  
> Moths entranced by a flame's fatal caress, they mistake the Reaper's gilded embrace for salvation.

## Introduction

In this **graveyard of stars**, Death grants all a bleak choice:

- **Linger** in an ossuary for the restless, eternally locked in combat—where ambition and despair intertwine, and where the fallen fuel the ascent of those hungrier to covet hope.  
- **Devour** the essence of unwitting tributes that challenge your claim—their fading hopes now yours to wield, crystallizing within your form. Weave the harvested bones into the tapestry of your destiny, forging a being from the echoes of those who dared to dream and ascended to scale the jagged peaks anchoring the souls to this stygian ark.

## Gameplay & Lore

A dark fusion of action-combat, surreal artistry, and cosmic horror. **Eidolon IV** thrusts you into a drifting cemetery of worlds, where your choices—and the remains of your foes—shape your power and ultimate fate.
