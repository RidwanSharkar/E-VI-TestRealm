# Eidolon
Adrift the twisting nether, Death offers an alluring covenant laced with grotesque mockery... moths entranced by a flame's fatal caress, they mistake the Reaper's gilded embrace for salvation.

## In this graveyard of stars, Death grants all a bleak choice:

### Linger in an ossuary for the restless, eternally locked in combat - where ambition and despair intertwine. And where the fallen fuel the ascent of the those hungrier to covet hope - the sole treasure these abyssal riptides conspire to ensure sinks through the cracks of the broken. 

### Devour the essence of unwitting tributes that challenge your claim - their fading hopes now yours to wield, crystallizing within your form. Weave the harvested bones into the tapestry of your destiny - a being forged from the echoes of those who dared to dream, ascended to scale the jagged peaks that anchor the souls to this stygian ark.
